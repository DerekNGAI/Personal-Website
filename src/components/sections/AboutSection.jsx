      <p className="text-base">
        As a Computer Science student graduating in August 2025, I specialize in Frontend
        development for web and mobile platforms, with strong expertise in ReactJS. I also have
        experience in backend development using Python, Flask, and Node.js, enabling me to build
        robust, full-stack applications. For my final-year project, I developed a machine
        learning-powered trading system, blending my passion for innovative technologies with
        practical problem-solving. Iâ€™m excited to create user-focused, impactful solutions and am
        eager to contribute to cutting-edge projects.
